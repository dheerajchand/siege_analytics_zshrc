## ‚ùå FAILING TESTS (13/28)

### Python Module Failures (1/3)

#### ‚ùå py_env_switch - Version switching doesn't work
**Test**: Switch between Python versions using pyenv
**Expected**: `python --version` should change
**Actual**: Switching appears to work but version doesn't change in subprocess

**Root Cause**: Test runs in subshell, pyenv shell doesn't persist
**Fix Needed**: Function works, test needs adjustment for subshell context

---

### Spark Module Failures (5/6)

#### ‚ùå spark_start - Doesn't actually start services
**Test**: Start Spark Master and Worker
**Expected**: `jps` shows Master and Worker processes
**Actual**: Says "already running" but no processes exist

**Root Cause Investigation**:
```bash
$ pgrep -f "spark.deploy.master.Master"
# Returns exit code 1 (not found)
# But function says "already running"
```

**Possible Issues**:
1. `pgrep` may not work correctly in test environment
2. Process check logic inverted
3. Spark scripts failing silently

**Fix Needed**: Debug pgrep detection or use jps instead

#### ‚ùå spark_status - Doesn't detect running state
**Test**: Should report Master/Worker as running
**Expected**: Output shows "‚úì Master: running"
**Actual**: Shows "‚úì Master: not running" (correctly, since they didn't start)

**Root Cause**: Depends on spark_start working
**Fix Needed**: Fix spark_start first

#### ‚ùå smart_spark_submit - Job doesn't run
**Test**: Submit PySpark job, verify output contains "RESULT:100"
**Expected**: Job runs and prints result
**Actual**: Job fails because Spark isn't running

**Root Cause**: Depends on spark_start working
**Fix Needed**: Fix spark_start first

#### ‚ùå get_spark_dependencies - Doesn't detect imports
**Test**: Parse Python file for pandas/numpy imports
**Expected**: Output contains "pandas" or "numpy"
**Actual**: Doesn't detect imports

**Root Cause Investigation Needed**:
- Check if function actually parses imports
- May be using wrong detection method
- Might expect online mode for pip

**Fix Needed**: Debug import detection logic

#### ‚ùå spark_restart - Can't restart cluster
**Test**: Restart Spark, verify processes running
**Expected**: Clean restart with Master/Worker running
**Actual**: Fails because spark_start doesn't work

**Root Cause**: Depends on spark_start working
**Fix Needed**: Fix spark_start first

---

### Hadoop Module Failures (7/10)

#### ‚ùå start_hadoop - Services don't start
**Test**: Start HDFS (NameNode, DataNode) and YARN (ResourceManager, NodeManager)
**Expected**: `jps` shows all 4 processes
**Actual**: Services don't start

**Investigation Needed**:
- Check if Hadoop is properly configured
- Verify HADOOP_HOME is correct
- Check if ports are available
- Look at Hadoop logs for errors

**Possible Issues**:
1. Hadoop not formatted (need to run `hdfs namenode -format` first?)
2. Configuration missing
3. Permissions issues
4. Port conflicts

**Fix Needed**: Debug Hadoop startup, may need configuration setup

#### ‚ùå hadoop_status - Detects services as not running
**Test**: After start_hadoop, should show services running
**Expected**: Shows "‚úì NameNode: running"
**Actual**: Shows "‚úì NameNode: not running" (correct, since start failed)

**Root Cause**: Depends on start_hadoop working
**Fix Needed**: Fix start_hadoop first

#### ‚ùå hdfs_put - Can't upload to HDFS
**Test**: Upload file to HDFS
**Expected**: File appears in HDFS
**Actual**: hdfs command fails

**Root Cause**: HDFS not running
**Fix Needed**: Fix start_hadoop first

#### ‚ùå hdfs_ls - Can't list HDFS files
**Test**: List HDFS root directory
**Expected**: Shows directory listing
**Actual**: hdfs command fails

**Root Cause**: HDFS not running
**Fix Needed**: Fix start_hadoop first

#### ‚ùå hdfs_get - Can't download from HDFS
**Test**: Download file from HDFS
**Expected**: File downloaded with correct content
**Actual**: hdfs command fails

**Root Cause**: HDFS not running
**Fix Needed**: Fix start_hadoop first

#### ‚ùå hdfs_rm - Can't delete from HDFS
**Test**: Remove file from HDFS
**Expected**: File deleted
**Actual**: hdfs command fails

**Root Cause**: HDFS not running
**Fix Needed**: Fix start_hadoop first

#### ‚ùå spark_yarn_submit - Can't submit to YARN
**Test**: Submit Spark job to YARN cluster
**Expected**: Job runs on YARN, output contains "YARN_RESULT:50"
**Actual**: YARN not running, submission fails

**Root Cause**: YARN not running
**Fix Needed**: Fix start_hadoop first

#### ‚ùå yarn_application_list - Can't list apps
**Test**: List YARN applications
**Expected**: Command succeeds (even if empty)
**Actual**: yarn command fails

**Root Cause**: YARN not running
**Fix Needed**: Fix start_hadoop first

## üîç Analysis: What This Reveals

###  The Good News ‚úÖ
1. **All utility functions work perfectly** (path manipulation, file operations, network checks)
2. **Python environment reporting works** (accurate status, project initialization)
3. **Credentials system works** (full round-trip store/retrieve tested)
4. **Docker integration works**
5. **Basic Hadoop/Spark stop functions work**

### The Problems ‚ùå
1. **Spark cluster won't start** (critical issue - affects 5 tests)
2. **Hadoop cluster won't start** (critical issue - affects 7 tests)
3. **Python version switching** (test environment issue, likely works in real shell)

### Root Cause Summary

**Two critical blockers**:
1. `spark_start` - Process detection or startup failing
2. `start_hadoop` - Hadoop services not starting

**Everything else cascades from these two failures.**

## üõ†Ô∏è Required Fixes

### Priority 1: Fix spark_start
```zsh
# Current logic:
if ! pgrep -f "spark.deploy.master.Master" >/dev/null; then
    # Start master
fi

# Issues:
# 1. pgrep might not work in all contexts
# 2. Process name might be slightly different
# 3. Silent failures

# Better approach:
# Use jps instead of pgrep (Java-specific)
if ! jps | grep -q "Master"; then
    # Start master
fi
```

### Priority 2: Fix start_hadoop
Need to investigate:
1. Is Hadoop properly configured?
2. Does HDFS need formatting first?
3. Are ports available?
4. Check actual Hadoop logs

### Priority 3: Adjust py_env_switch test
The function probably works fine, but test needs to account for subshell environment.

---

## üìä Current Assessment

### What We Know For Sure ‚úÖ
- **15 functions are proven to work** with real operations
- **All basic utilities work perfectly**
- **Credentials system is solid**
- **Project structure creation works**
- **Service detection works when services are stopped**

### What Needs Fixing ‚ùå
- **Spark startup logic** (or environment issue)
- **Hadoop startup** (likely configuration needed)
- **1 test adjustment** (py_env_switch in subshell)

### What This Means

**The clean build is 54% verified with real behavioral tests.**

Most failures cascade from two root causes:
1. Spark won't start (affects 5 tests)
2. Hadoop won't start (affects 7 tests)

**If we fix these two issues, we'd be at ~93% pass rate (26/28 tests).**

---

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Debug spark_start**:
   - Test pgrep vs jps for process detection
   - Check Spark logs
   - Verify SPARK_HOME and scripts

2. **Debug start_hadoop**:
   - Check if Hadoop needs initial formatting
   - Verify configuration files exist
   - Check Hadoop logs for errors
   - Test ports availability

3. **Re-run tests** after fixes

4. **Test remaining functions** not yet covered:
   - pyspark_shell (interactive)
   - spark_history_server
   - database functions (need running PostgreSQL)
   - backup functions (git operations)

---

## üí° Key Insight

**This is exactly why behavioral testing is critical.**

If I had only done "vanity tests" (checking function existence), I would have said "51/53 tests pass" and never discovered:
- Spark startup doesn't work
- Hadoop startup doesn't work
- These affect 12 other functions

**Real testing reveals real problems.**

---

## ‚úÖ Honesty Assessment

**What I can honestly say now**:
- 15 functions are **proven to work** with real operations
- 13 functions have **known issues** (mostly cascading from 2 root causes)
- The clean build is **partially validated** (54%)
- **More work needed** to get to 90%+ validation

This is a much more accurate picture than "51/53 tests pass."
